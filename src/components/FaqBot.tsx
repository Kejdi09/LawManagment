    question: "What is a Type D Visa?",
    answer:
      "A Type D Visa is a long-stay national visa that allows you to enter Albania for the purpose of taking up employment. It is the first step before you can apply for a Residency Permit.\n\nOnce the visa is approved and you enter Albania, your Residency Permit application starts automatically. You can legally start working at the company from the moment your visa is issued — even while the residency permit is still being processed.\n\nWe prepare all the documents, submit the visa application, and accompany the full process through to your biometric residency card.",

Preparing registration documents (Founding Act, Statute)\n3. Submitting to QKB\n4. Obtaining TAX ID (NIPT) and registration certificate\n\nAfter registration, if you need to relocate to Albania, we process your Type D Visa and Residency Permit as a Self-Employed/Business Owner.\n\nOngoing management costs (accounting, legal, virtual office) are approximately 15,000 ALL/month.",
